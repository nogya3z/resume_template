# LaTeX Resume Project

This repository contains a resume written in LaTeX.

What is Latex?  Latex is a markup language used to create PDFs and is quite commonly used in academia.

If you are tech savy, or at the very least understand a bit of code, installing packages, and compiling artifacts, then it shouldn't be too hard to get started. For those less technical, you can use a like [overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) to simplify creating and compiling the latex code into a PDF.

## Setup

There are various instructions online on how to setup a LaTeX environment, which will vary depending on your environment. I personally used Visual Studio Code with the `LaTeX Workshop` extension to simplify compilation. This is a convenienve and not a necessity as you can build the pdf via running CLI commands.

## Stylistic Decisions

I am grateful for the following [template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/ethans-resume-template/kwmtbntyvhhr) I found on overleaf, which I based my `standard` resume on. It is the most traditional, black and white, concise format of a resume that seems to be most common amongst proffesionals. You can't go wrong with it.

One simple change I made was moving the contact options to the left of the about section which have an added functionality of being clickable and opening to their associated hyperlink ie Github, Linkedin, etc. I like this because it saves spaces and provides some intuitive access to more information.

I personally prefer a bit more flare and pop to my style. 

The consequence of deviating to something more flashy will depend on your style, industry, and profession.

I recommend browsing their resume templates for inspiration on other styles of resumes.
